## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS

This project was built as a mock client website to represent the main informational page for a bakery. Semantic HTML was used to structure the content, while custom CSS handled layout, typography, and visual styling to reflect a warm, approachable brand.

The site includes common bakery website sections such as an overview of offerings, featured items, and calls to action. While the site is static, the layout and content hierarchy were designed to feel realistic and client-ready.

Responsiveness was implemented using custom media queries. Instead of targeting specific devices, breakpoints were chosen based on when the layout or content needed adjustment, ensuring the design remains visually balanced and usable across a wide range of screen sizes.

## Optimizations

After the initial build, spacing, typography, and layout flow were refined to improve readability and consistency across screen widths. Content decisions were made based on visual clarity, removing or simplifying elements that did not translate well to smaller screens.

## Future Improvements

Future enhancements could include adding additional pages such as a full menu, ordering information, or contact details, as well as improving accessibility and introducing light interactivity.

## Lessons Learned:

This project highlighted the importance of designing with content-first responsiveness in mind. By letting the layout and content dictate breakpoints, rather than rigid screen sizes, the site achieved a more natural and professional responsive experience.
